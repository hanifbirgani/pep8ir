#: ../../_pep8.rst:24
msgid "One of Guido's key insights is that code is read much more often than it is written.  The guidelines provided here are intended to improve the readability of code and make it consistent across the wide spectrum of Python code.  As PEP 20 says, \"Readability counts\"."

#: ../../_pep8.rst:29

msgid "When the conditional part of an ``if``-statement is long enough to require that it be written across multiple lines, it's worth noting that the combination of a two character keyword (i.e. ``if``), plus a single space, plus an opening parenthesis creates a natural 4-space indent for the subsequent lines of the multiline conditional.  This can produce a visual conflict with the indented suite of code nested inside the ``if``-statement, which would also naturally be indented to 4 spaces.  This PEP takes no explicit position on how (or whether) to further visually distinguish such conditional lines from the nested suite inside the ``if``-statement. Acceptable options in this situation include, but are not limited to::"

msgid "The default wrapping in most tools disrupts the visual structure of the code, making it more difficult to understand. The limits are chosen to avoid wrapping in editors with the window width set to 80, even if the tool places a marker glyph in the final column when wrapping lines. Some web based tools may not offer dynamic line wrapping at all."
msgstr ""

#: ../../_pep8.rst:200

msgid "For decades the recommended style was to break after binary operators. But this can hurt readability in two ways: the operators tend to get scattered across different columns on the screen, and each operator is moved away from its operand and onto the previous line.  Here, the eye has to do extra work to tell which items are added and which are subtracted::"
